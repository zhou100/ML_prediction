# Introduction

 Temporal Poverty Prediction using Satellite Imagery[@chentemporal].

1. measuring and tracking areas of poor is a necessary step for targeting aid and guiding policy decisions.
2. obtaining data is time and labor intensive


policy decision making based on poor data  [@blumenstock2016fighting]

based on household survey and other reliable data  [@jean2016combining]
