abstract = {Policy-makers in the world's poorest countries are often forced to make decisions based on limited data. Consider Angola, which recently conducted its first postcolonial census. In the 44 years that elapsed between the prior census and the recent one, the country's population grew from 5.6 million to 24.3 million, and the country experienced a protracted civil war that displaced millions of citizens. In situations where reliable survey data are missing or out of date, a novel line of research offers promising alternatives. On page 790 of this issue, Jean et al. (1) apply recent advances in machine learning to high-resolution satellite imagery to accurately measure regional poverty in Africa. Traditionally, wealth and poverty are measured through surveys of household income and consumption (2). These data provide a critical input to the world's most prominent antipoverty programs, from basic cash transfer programs to multifaceted aid programs designed to target the extreme poor (3). However, nationally representative surveys cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars to collect, and many developing countries go for decades without updating their estimates. Over the past few decades, researchers have begun to develop different techniques for estimating poverty remotely. Initial work explored the potential of “nightlights” data: satellite photographs taken at night that capture light emitted from Earth's surface. Since such imagery first became available in the early 1970s, it was evident that wealthy regions tended to shine brightest (4). Recent studies have found a strong correlation between nightlight luminosity and traditional measures of economic productivity and growth (5, 6). Nightlight-based measures are now frequently used by researchers, for instance to study the impact of sanctions on the economy of North Korea (7), where official statistics are dubious. A series of studies in wealthy nations explore how data from the internet and social media can provide proxies for economic activity (8, 9). Mining the tweets and search queries of millions of individuals promises real-time alternatives to more traditional methods of data collection. However, these approaches are less relevant to remote and developing regions, where internet infrastructure is limited and few people use social media. In developing countries, researchers have found ways to measure wealth and poverty using the digital footprints left behind in the transaction logs of mobile phones, which are increasingly ubiquitous even in very poor regions. Regional patterns of mobile phone use correlate with the regional distribution of wealth (10). This relationship persists at the individual level, such that machine learning algorithms can infer an individual subscriber's socioeconomic status directly from his or her history of mobile phone use. The individual predictions can be aggregated into regional measures of wealth that are about as accurate as a 5-year-old household survey (11). Phone-based proxies for wealth are beginning to be used in research, e.g., to understand how new technologies differentially benefit the wealthy and the poor (12) and to assess the creditworthiness of would-be borrowers (13). Although promising, these nontraditional methods have caveats. As Jean et al. show, nightlights data are less effective at differentiating between regions at the bottom end of the income distribution, where satellite images appear uniformly dark. And mobile phone data are owned by mobile phone operators and are generally not available to policy-makers. By contrast, Jean et al. use only publicly available data. Taking nightlights as their starting point, the authors have devised a clever technique to also extract information from daytime satellite imagery. Daytime imagery is taken at much higher resolution than nighttime imagery. It thus contains visible features—such as paved roads and metal roofs—that make it possible to differentiate between poor and ultrapoor regions. Jean et al.'s insight was to apply state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to the daytime imagery to extract these features. When given large quantities of data with labeled patterns, these algorithms excel at generalizing those patterns to new data. For instance, search engines use this technology to automatically label the contents of billions of internet photos. The authors use a convolutional neural network to learn the relationship between millions of daytime satellite images (which are rich in detail) and nighttime images (where light areas are assumed to be wealthy). In this way, the network learns which features in the daytime imagery are indicative of economic activity (see the figure). Knowledge of those features enabled the authors to accurately reconstruct survey-based indicators of regional poverty, improving on results from simpler models that relied solely on nightlights or mobile phone data. How might these results change the way that we measure and target poverty? Perhaps the most immediate application is as a source of inexpensive, interim national statistics. Jean et al.'s results indicate that a model trained in one country can be used in another, creating options for countries where no recent survey data exist. For social welfare programs, some of which already use satellite imagery to identify eligible recipients (14), higher-fidelity estimates of poverty can help to ensure that resources get to those with the greatest need. Other applications are on the horizon. Remotely sourced satellite and mobile phone data are updated frequently and can be used to generate nearly real-time estimates of regional vulnerability. Once it is possible to estimate short-term changes in wealth and poverty, new approaches to program monitoring and impact evaluation will follow.},
